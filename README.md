# ch10bonusAmounts

Create a project with a structure for employees. The structure contains a string for the employee name, an integer for the sales amount for the employee, and a double for the bonus for the employee. Create an array to hold 5 of these employee structures, and create a pointer to that array. Write a function that accepts a pointer to the array to ask the user for the employee names and sales figures to fill the array of structures. Write a function that accepts a pointer to the array to determine the bonus for each employee and store it in the structure in the array. The rules for determining the bonus amounts are: if the employee's sales are $10,000 or more, they get a bonus of 10% of the sales figure; if the employee's sales are $5,000 or more, they get a bonus of 5% of the sales figure; otherwise, the employee gets a bonus of $100. Write a function that accepts a pointer to the array to display the information in the structure. Use pointer notation for referencing the objects in the array. Use the structure pointer operator, "->", to reference the variables of the structure. You should not use brackets, [ ], except when declaring the array.

See Section 10.7 about using a pointer as a parameter in a function. See Section 10.11 for information about the structure pointer operator, and program 10.17 for an example that passes pointers to objects in a function and uses the structure pointer operator.

Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for different sets of sales numbers. Create 3 test cases. Run your code, enter the data from each test case, and compare your results to those test cases. Take screenshots of all 3 results.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases  AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
